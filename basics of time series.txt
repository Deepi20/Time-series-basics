Assumptions of a Time sseries forecasting model
1.Time is continuous
2. It is stationary

Investigate the components of a time series
-To extract the trend, seasonality and random terms from the model using various decomposition techniques

There are 2 functions in R to do that
1.decompose()
2.stl()

Autocorrelation
-It is the coreelation between the time series with lags itself

Partial Autocorrelation
-It is correlation between the time series with lags itself with linear dependance of all the lags between them is removed



Augmented Dickey Fuller test is the test used to test the stationarity of a time series

If in case it is not stationary we add seasonal adjustment and then test it again using ADF test


There are different forecasting methods namely
1.Moving Average method
2.Weighted moving average
3.Auto Regressive Method
4.Auto Regressive Moving average method
5.Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average method
6.Simple exponential smoothing
7.Double exponential smoothing
8.Triple exponential smoothing
